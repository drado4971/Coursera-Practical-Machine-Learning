Background
Subjects were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
* Exactly according to the specification (Class A)
* Throwing the elbows to the front (Class B) - mistake
* Lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C) - mistake
* Lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) - mistake
* Throwing the hips to the front (Class E) - mistake

Accelerometers were located on
1. belt
2. forearm
3. arm

Data Preprocessing
we load the training and testing set from the online sources and then split the training set further into training and test sets.

library(caret)
setwd("Coursera-Practical-Machine-Learning/")
trainURL <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testURL <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
training <- read.csv(url(trainURL))
testing <- read.csv(url(testURL))
label <- createDataPartition(training$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train <- training[label, ]
test <- training[-label, ]

From among 160 variables present in the dataset, some variables have nearly zero variance whereas some
contain a lot of NA terms which need to be excluded from the dataset. Moreover, other 5 variables used for
identification can also be removed.
NZV <- nearZeroVar(train)
train <- train[ ,-NZV]
test <- test[ ,-NZV]
label <- apply(train, 2, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.95
train <- train[, -which(label, label == FALSE)]
test <- test[, -which(label, label == FALSE)]
train <- train[ , -(1:5)]
test <- test[ , -(1:5)]
As a result of the preprocessing steps, we were able to reduce 160 variables to 54.

Prediction Model Selection
We will use 3 methods to model the training set and thereby choose the one having the best accuracy
to predict the outcome variable in the testing set. The methods are Decision Tree, Random Forest and
Generalized Boosted Model.
A confusion matrix plotted at the end of each model will help visualize the analysis better.

As Random Forest offers the maximum accuracy of 99.75%, we will go with Random Forest Model to predict
our test data class variable.
